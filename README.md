==================

A book that came from an idea about mind readers.

“After the loss of her husband and three children in a bus crash, the pieces of Marrula’s life slowly begin to piece together until she surprisingly finds a new ability to expand her consciousness to envelop the thoughts of those around her. As she struggles with this new information she decides to use it to bring people together by arranging situations for those whose thoughts she has listened in to. 

It begins with the staging of innocent love connections and coincidences that only she knows the true nature of. Charged with a new sense of identify she ups the stakes until the unthinkable occurs. 

She encounters another like her.

And he has different ideas.
